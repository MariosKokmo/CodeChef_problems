# CodeChef_problems
This is a repository with my solutions to various problems on CodeChef.

It is an informal attempt to document my journey in "Competitive Programming".

Disclaimer: This is not really my CP journey, it merely shadows my ability to solve
problems of a given difficulty, without the time constraints of a CP round.

Honor Code: All the problems have been solved without hints or solution-peeking (unless explicitly stated).
It would be worthless to do so.
